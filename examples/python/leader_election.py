"""Leader Election & Decision

Spawns 3 agents, runs a leader election (one agent declines),
then the elected leader issues a binding decision.

Elections have a 2-second opt-out window. After that, the server
picks randomly from remaining candidates.

Usage:
    cargo run -p cowchat-server -- serve
    python examples/python/leader_election.py
